        <p>
          Kavan Cardoza aka Kavan TheKid first became a Conceptual/Surrealist
          photographer in 2014.
          <br />
          He started his exploration with a 365 project, after stumbling into
          Self Portrait Photography. The 365 project became a source of therapy
          for Kavan, with each photo carrying a heavy emotion.
          <br />
          Over the course of the next few years, Kavan beat his first serious
          bout of depression and his technical skillset as a photographer
          developed further.
          <br />
          In 2018, he had hit rock bottom. His work had lesser emotions put into
          them as usual, as it felt tiresome for him. He was not happy with who
          he was or where he was going. That's when he decided to start his
          intense road to recovery, with the support of his family and friends.
          <br />
          In 2019, he made a promise to only produce the most personal and
          highest quality work he could create. He also started to work on his
          first photography book "Stay Inside & Don't Let The Dreams Out", which
          is out for sale now.
          <a href="artwork.html" style="padding-left:300px;">Buy book!</a>
          <br/>
          He also got nominated and won awards such as:
          <br />
          Digitally Enhanced Photography - 1st Place (International Photography
          Awards (IPAs))
          Stocksy United Photography Awards - Top 25 Finalist (2019 Beautiful
          Bizarre Art Prize)
        </p>

          Kavan TheKid's message to people struggling with mental health issues:
          <br />
          First and foremost you are not alone. There is always someone who
          cares for you. There is always someone who wants you here and who is
          willing to talk to you. Second, don’t be afraid to admit you need
          help. It’s probably the hardest thing to do and requires great
          strength. But each and every single person who is experiencing these
          emotions or feelings has that strength inside them.
        </p>
